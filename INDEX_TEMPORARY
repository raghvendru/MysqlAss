CREATE INDEX index_name ON tbl_name (index_columns);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name ON tbl_name (index_columns);
To drop an index, use either a DROP INDEX or an ALTER TABLE statement.
DROP INDEX index_name  ON tbl_name; 
ALTER TABLE tbl_name DROP INDEX index_name; 
Show index
show index from emp \G;
INDEX, you must name the index to be dropped:
DROP INDEX index_name ON tbl_name;
multiple indexes can not be created with a single statement.


TEMPORARY
If you add the TEMPORARY keyword to a table-creation statement, the server creates a temporary table that disappears automatically when your connection to the server terminates 
DROP TABLE statement is not needed to getrid of the table
A TEMPORARY table is visible only to the client that creates the table.
 Different clients can each create a TEMPORARY table with the same name and without conflict because eachclient sees only the table that it created. 
Deprecated as of MySQL 8.0.13; expect it to be removed in future version
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tbl_name;
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE tbl_name
