VIEWS

Virtual table based on the result-set of  SQL statement and that is Stored in the database with some name. 
A view can contain all rows of a table or select rows from a table. 
A view can be created from one or many tables which depends on the written SQL query to create a view.
Restrict access to the data such that a user can see and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.
Summarize data from various tables which can be used to generate reports.
If table structure is changed  then the view definition also has to be changed.
Simple View
A view based on only a single table, which doesn't contain GROUP BY clause and any functions.
Complex View
A view based on multiple tables, which contain GROUP BY clause and functions.
Inline View
 A view based on a subquery in FROM Clause, that subquery creates a temporary table and simplifies the complex query.
Materialized View
 A view that stores the definition as well as data. It creates replicas of data by storing it physically.

create view empage(empcode,age) 
as (select empcode, timestampdiff(year,birthdate,curdate()) 
from emp);

CREATE VIEW EMPPAY (EmpCode, NetPay,                                             SalMonth) AS
     ( SELECT	     EmpCode, 
                           (Basic + Allow - Deduct), SalMonth
       FROM    Salary );


CREATE VIEW DeptEmpCount 
		(DeptCode, DeptEmpCount) AS
(SELECT	DeptCode, count(*)
FROM		Emp
GROUP BY   DeptCode);


alter view emppay(empcode,netpay,salmonth) 
as (select empcode, (basic+allow-deduct)+1000,salmonth from salary);
DROP VIEW EMPPAY;
